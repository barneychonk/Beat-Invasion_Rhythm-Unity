## Game Features
* **Rhythm Gameplay:** Hit notes in sync with the track to score points and damage enemies.

## System Architecture
The game utilizes an Object-Oriented architecture to manage game states and interactions. Key classes include:

* **`ScoreManager`**: Tracks current combos, final scores, and effect application.
* **`NoteBase`**: A parent class for different note types (`NoteSingleHit`, `NoteDoubleHit`, `NoteHoldHit`) to share common logic like miss detection and visual effects.
